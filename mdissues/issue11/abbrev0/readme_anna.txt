work on issue 11 for MD dictionary.
MD abbreviations

Instructions for Anna.

The ocr.txt file was prepared by @gasyoun [Ref:](https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/csl-orig/issues/695#issuecomment-999127351).

The main task is to prepare a 'clean' version of this file. (See below for what 'clean' means in this context.)

ocr_edit.txt starts as a copy of ocr.txt, with
* first line removed
* blank lines removed.

Anna's task is to edit the ocr_edit.txt file.

After edit, the format should be
1. One abbreviation per line. 
2. Each line has form: abbrev<TAB>= tooltip
3. spelling of text for abbrev and tooltip should be checked against scan.

I think that's it!  This is a fairly straightforward task.

To get started, clone (or pull) this repository
  https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MD.

When ocr_edit.txt is cleaned up,  push repository to Github and notify me
in a message in https://github.com/sanskrit-lexicon/MD/issues/11.
