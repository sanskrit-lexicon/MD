3. 'duplicate P.'
----- 
'P.' appears with two distinct meanings
P.	= Parasmaipada.
𝑃.	= Purāṇa.
Currently, the Special extended ascii char '𝑃'
is used in abbrev0 for Purāṇa.  
the md.txt digitization will need corresponding adjustment.
4. duplicate 'prn.'
originals:
pn., prn.	= pronoun.
prn.	= pronoun, pronominal.
Solution:
a. remove 'prn.	= pronoun, pronominal.'
